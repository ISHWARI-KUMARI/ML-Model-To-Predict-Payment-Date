# ML-Model-To-Predict-Payment-Date

## Aim

Our aim from the project is to make use of pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries from python to extract insights from the data, & scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.

Secondly, to learn how to hypertune the parameters.

And in the end, to predict the payment date and categorize the invoice into different buckets based on predicted payment date using machine learning algorithms.

Invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. 

## Attributes in the dataset

Business Code, Customer Number, Customer Name, Clear Date, Business Year, Doc Id, Posting Date, Due In Date, Document Create Date, Invoice Currency, Document Type, Posting ID, Area Business, Baseline Create Date, Total Open Amount, Customer Payment Terms, Invoice ID
